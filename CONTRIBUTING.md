## Adding to the list of Packages

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Ideally adhere to [standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) as the coding style.
- [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) all the things.
- Use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
- Maintain an extensive [README](https://github.com/spatie/skeleton-js/blob/master/README.md).
- [Excludes non-essential files in .gitattributes](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/2jzp6k/i_dont_need_your_tests_in_my_production).
